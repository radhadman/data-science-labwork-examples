    "In this lab, you will create a very simple implementation of a Bloom Filter. This will be for the application of spam filtering, as discussed in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you implement here will be a very simple demonstration of the basic concept of Bloom Filters, and is not an actual demonstration of applying Bloom Filters to massively large streaming data. The latter topic could be a fun term project idea, however, if you wanted to create your own scalable implementation of a Bloom Filter for some application. The point of this lab is to get a conceptual understanding of how Bloom Filters work.\n"

    "  * One list containing a mix of allowed and spam addresses.\n",
    "* Create the bit array using a Python list. Make it small (e.g. size 10 or 20) for the purposes of this lab. Normally we would make it extremely large to try to avoid collisions, but here it will be instructive to see how collisions happen.\n",
    "* Create a small list of allowed (non-spam) email addresses (strings). For example, this could be your own email address and a couple of your friendsâ€™ email addresses.\n",
    "* Write a loop that iterates over the allowed email addresses, hashes each one and sets the corresponding bit of the bit array to 1.\n",
    "* Now create a small list of new email addresses, e.g. a mix of friendly and spam addresses. Loop over this second list, hash each email address and check whether the corresponding bit of the bit array is 1. \n",
    "* For each of the new email addresses, just print out a message about whether it is spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there false positives, i.e. spams that got through? If so, make sure you understand how they got through (because of collisions). Try making the bit array much larger and see if there are any false positives now.\n",
